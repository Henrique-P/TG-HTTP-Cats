# TG-HTTP-Cats
This bot will reply to a HTTP code with a cat picture from http.cat. This both is not affiliated with the before-mentioned website.

In private chat the bot will only reply to codes from 100-599 and if there's no cat for that code (or the code doesn't exist) it will randomly choose a valid one and send you a kitty.

The filtering is made by a regex filter on the handler. Works the same for the inline mode, but the bot will reply "not found" for an invalid code.

Made in 5 hours with care.
